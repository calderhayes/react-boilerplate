# React Typescript Flux Template

**Not yet complete**
**Use at your own risk**


TODO: Split up UI into Smart (stateful components / Containers) and Dumb (functional components / Presentation)

TODO: Solidify authentication strategy
TODO: Solidify what actions are doing vs reducers in terms of error handling
TODO: Solidify error message handling, what provides the keys, what creates the keys (this may just be documentation)
TODO: Create an automated front end task handler (refresh token), have a centralized control that handles this in a generalized way
TODO: Take a look at tsfmt

This is a simple collection of utilities forming a transparent platform to start working off of for medium to large scale front end React applications.

This is in no way perfect, but is using an accumulation of techniques and technology that I found useful in my other React projects.

I am releasing this with an MIT license both for others benefit, and hopefully also to learn from others.
