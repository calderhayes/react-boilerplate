# React Typescript Flux Template

This is a simple collection of utilities forming a transparent platform to start working off of for medium to large scale front end React applications.

This is in no way perfect, but is using an accumulation of techniques and technology that I found useful in my other React projects.

I am releasing this with an MIT license both for others benefit, and hopefully also to learn from others.


## Build

tsc
